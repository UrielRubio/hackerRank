PROBLEM
Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with combinations 
and permutations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning 
materials! 

Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without 
replacing them. 
What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

SOLUTION
Its a combination because order doesn't matter

n = 52
r = 13
C(n, r) = C(52, 13) = n!/(r!*(n-r)!) = 52!/(13!*(52-13)!)

S={52}
A=1/52
A=1/12
