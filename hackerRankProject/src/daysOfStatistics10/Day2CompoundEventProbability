PROBLEM
Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability 
of a compound event. We recommend you review today's 
Probability Tutorial before attempting this challenge.

Task
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

    Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
	Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
	Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. 
What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 
2 are red and 1 is black?

SOLUTION

Urn X
P(take 1 red ball) = 4 / 7
P(take 1 black ball) = 3 / 7

Urn Y
P(take 1 red ball) = 5 / 9
P(take 1 black ball) = 4 / 9

Urn Z
P(take 1 red ball) = 4 / 8 = 1 / 2
P(take 1 black ball) = 4 / 8 = 1 / 2


P(take 1 red ball) = 4/7 x 5/9 x 1/2 = 20 / 126
P(take 1 black ball) = 3/7 x 4/9 x 1/2 = 12 /126

P(red, red, black) = 20/126 + 20/126 + 12/126 = 52/126 = 26 /63
